            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>A lot of people are not aware of air pollution. They read about it in the newspaper but don’t think
                that this problem affects their own lives. Even those who are concerned about it have hard times
                to comprehend political decisions which have an impact on air pollution because they don’t have access
                to the right tools. The existing analysis tools are mostly designed for scientists. Scientists need
                tools with a lot of functionalities, which results in higher complexity, a knowledge barrier which an average
                person cannot overcome.
            </p>

            <h3>Our solution</h3>
            <p>We are giving interested people a simple tool for obtaining statistical information about the air
                pollution of Madrid. On our website the user can choose between five different pollutants (CO, NO_2,
                O_3, PM10, SO_2). It also explains the impact of these pollutants on health. After the user has chosen
                a pollutant he can now choose one year between 2001 and 2018 to see the development of the concentration
                over the year. He has also the option to choose a second year. Now both concentration levels will be
                shown in a diagram. This allows the user a direct comparison of two years. Using diagram instead of a
                table allows an easier understanding of the data. We have chosen a line diagram because it is the most 
                common figure for pollution time series and with that its most likely
                to be understood without any problems.
            </p>

            <h3>Pollutants</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SO_2:</strong> Sulphur dioxide level measured in μg/m³. High levels of sulphur dioxide can
                    produce irritation in the skin and membranes, and worsen asthma or heart diseases in sensitive
                    groups.</li>
                <li><strong>CO:</strong> Carbon monoxide level measured in mg/m³. Carbon monoxide poisoning involves
                    headaches, dizziness and confusion in short exposures and can result in loss of consciousness,
                    arrhythmias, seizures or even death in the long term.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>NO_2:</strong> Nitrogen dioxide level measured in μg/m³. Long-term exposure is a cause of
                    chronic lung diseases, and are harmful for the vegetation.</li>
                <li><strong>PM10:</strong> Particles smaller than 10 μm measured in μg/m³. Even though the cannot
                    penetrate the alveolus, they can still penetrate through the lungs and affect other organs. Long
                    term exposure can result in lung cancer and cardiovascular complications.</li>
                <li><strong>O_3:</strong> Ozone level measured in μg/m³. High levels can produce asthma, bronchitis or
                    other chronic pulmonary diseases in sensitive groups or outdoor workers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Comparison with existing work on the problem</h3>
            <p>
                Our project focuses solely on the air pollution in Madrid. So while there is already a lot of work on
                air pollution in general, this is not the case for this particular region.
                Nevertheless, we were able to find a scientific article about it which was published in Journal of
                Analytical Methods in Chemistry with the title “Statistical Tools for Air Pollution Assessment:
                Multivariate and Spatial Analysis Studies in the Madrid Region”. The authors carried out a mapping of
                the distribution of the pollutants nitrogen oxides (NO, NO_2), ozone (O_3) and particles (PM10) to show
                the connection between them and also with the demography of the region. For their work, they used data
                from the city and province of Madrid measured by 22 stations between 2010 and 2017.<br>
                The nature of this article refers to one of the problems we want to solve with our project. The target
                group are other scientists or politicians. The results of this study may allow these people to take
                appropriate action against pollution. However, our main objective is to create an easy-to-understand
                representation of the development of air pollution for an average person. So that this person can use it
                to track the effects of political decisions against environment.
                In a larger picture, a work like the one above may have been the basis of a political decision which
                impact can be observed with the tool we created.<br><br>
